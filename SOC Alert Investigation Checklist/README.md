## Security Incident Investigation Form

I have put together a standardized form to record imprtant information gathered during the triage and investigation process as it is crucial to take good records when performing an investigation. This is not only helpful to yourself but to your peers as well when incidents are escalated to higher tier analysts, incident responders, or threat hunters.

[Here is a link to the form](https://github.com/Rootcipher8112/BlueTeamTools/blob/main/SOC%20Alert%20Investigation%20Checklist/Security%20Incident%20Investigation%20Form.md)

## Purpose

These checklists provide structured guidance for investigating security alerts, ensuring consistency, thoroughness, and efficiency in SOC operations. Each checklist includes key actions, tools to use, and indicators to validate during the investigation process.
