# Anomaly Detection Alert Investigation Checklist

This checklist provides steps for investigating alerts generated by anomaly detection systems, focusing on identifying and understanding unusual activity within the network.

---

### 1. Verify and Triage

- **Classify Anomaly Type**: Review the alert to understand the nature of the anomaly (e.g., unusual login, network spike).
- **Check for False Positives**: Validate the anomaly by correlating with regular activity patterns (e.g., business hours, maintenance windows).

---

### 2. Data Collection

- **Gather Related Logs**: Collect logs from the source of the anomaly, such as network logs, application logs, or system event logs.
- **Cross-Check User and Endpoint Activity**: Review any related activities by the affected user or device, including recent login times or application access.

---

### 3. Investigation and Analysis

- **Correlate with Other Alerts**: Identify if similar anomalies occurred recently or if other alerts correlate with the anomaly.
- **Use Threat Intelligence**: Query any suspicious IPs, file hashes, or domains for potential IOCs that might be connected to the anomaly.

---

### 4. Containment and Mitigation

- **Isolate Unusual Activity**: If possible, isolate the system or restrict user access temporarily until further analysis is complete.
- **Enforce Additional Controls**: Consider enabling MFA for user accounts involved or adding stricter firewall rules if network-related.

---

### 5. Documentation and Post-Incident Review

- **Document Steps and Findings**: Record the anomaly details, investigation steps, and findings in detail.
- **Review Detection Rules**: Adjust anomaly detection thresholds or rules if this alert was deemed to be a false positive or required refinement.
