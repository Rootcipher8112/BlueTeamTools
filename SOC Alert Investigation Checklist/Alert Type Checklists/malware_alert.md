# Malware Alert Investigation Checklist

This checklist outlines steps for investigating malware alerts, from identifying the infection source to eradicating the threat.

---

### 1. Verify and Triage

- **Validate Malware Type**: Review the alert to identify the type of malware (e.g., ransomware, trojan, spyware).
- **Assess Infection Scope**: Determine if the infection is limited to one device or has spread across the network.

---

### 2. Data Collection

- **Review Endpoint Logs**: Collect logs from affected endpoints (file creation, processes started, network connections).
- **Obtain Hashes and File Paths**: Note malware hashes and file paths for identification and analysis.

---

### 3. Investigation and Analysis

- **Correlate with Other Alerts**: Check for related alerts or similar infections on other endpoints.
- **Run Threat Intel Queries**: Look up hashes, domains, and IPs in threat intelligence databases.

---

### 4. Containment and Eradication

- **Isolate Affected Devices**: Disconnect infected devices from the network to prevent further spread.
- **Remove Malware**: Use antivirus or endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to eliminate malware and affected files.

### 5. Documentation and Closure

- **Record Incident Details**: Document analysis, containment, and eradication steps.
- **Monitor for Reoccurrence**: Set up monitoring to detect potential re-infection.
