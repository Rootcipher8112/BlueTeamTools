## Visualization of Scan Results

This folder contains scripts for visualizing the results of vulnerability scans, helping to identify trends, focus areas, and overall security posture.

---

### This Section covers notes for each of the scripts

### Nmap Visualization Script notes

**Input Data:** The script expects a list of hosts with their open ports. You can modify this to take real Nmap output in JSON format.

**Output:** The script generates a bar chart showing how many open ports each host has, allowing you to quickly see which hosts have more exposure.


### Vulnerability Trends Over Time Script notes

**Input Data:** The script expects a list of scan dates and the number of vulnerabilities discovered during each scan.

**Output:** The script generates a line chart showing how the number of vulnerabilities changes over time, helping to track improvements or regressions in security posture.


### Port Distribution Pie Chart Script notes

**Input Data:** The script expects a dictionary where the keys are port numbers and the values are how many hosts have those ports open.

**Output:** The script generates a pie chart that shows the distribution of open ports, giving insight into which ports are most exposed in your network.
