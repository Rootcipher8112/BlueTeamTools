## Risk Scoring and Prioritization
This folder will include scripts that parse vulnerability scan results and assign risk scores based on severity levels, helping you prioritize vulnerabilities for remediation.

### Both of these scripts use an input file similar to the example listed below (json format)

    [
    {
        "name": "Vulnerability A",
        "cvssScore": 9.3,
        "host": "192.168.1.10",
        "description": "Critical vulnerability in service XYZ"
    },
    {
        "name": "Vulnerability B",
        "cvssScore": 6.5,
        "host": "192.168.1.20",
        "description": "Medium severity vulnerability in application ABC"
    }
    ]

### CVSS Score Parser Output
The script will categorize each vulnerability as Critical, High, Medium, or Low based on its CVSS score and print the details for review.

### Vulnerability Risk Score Calculator Output
It calculates the total CVSS score for each host and ranks them based on overall risk, helping you prioritize remediation efforts.
