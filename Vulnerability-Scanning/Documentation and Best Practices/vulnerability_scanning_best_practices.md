# Vulnerability Scanning Best Practices

Effective vulnerability scanning helps organizations identify and mitigate security weaknesses before they can be exploited. Follow these best practices to maximize the impact of your scans.

---

## 1. Define Your Scope

Before performing any vulnerability scan, clearly define the scope of your scan:

- Identify critical assets that must be scanned (e.g., servers, endpoints, databases).
- Set boundaries to avoid scanning unnecessary or sensitive systems.
- Use exclusion lists (such as those provided in `nmap_exclusion.conf`) to ensure that trusted IPs or networks are not scanned.

---

## 2. Schedule Regular Scans

Vulnerability scanning is not a one-time event. Implement a schedule that includes regular scans:

- **Weekly Scans:** For critical systems and high-risk environments.
- **Monthly Scans:** For less critical assets and systems.
- **After Major Changes:** Scan after significant updates, software installations, or network changes to identify any new vulnerabilities.

Use tools like cron jobs (see `/automation`) to automate scans at defined intervals.

## 3. Choose the Right Tools

Selecting the right vulnerability scanner depends on your environment:

- **Nmap:** Great for network discovery and basic vulnerability detection.
- **Nessus:** Offers comprehensive vulnerability scanning with detailed reports.
- **OpenVAS:** An open-source alternative with strong detection capabilities.

For web application security, tools like **Acunetix** and **Qualys** provide specialized scanning for web vulnerabilities.

## 4. Focus on High-Impact Vulnerabilities

Vulnerability scans often generate large volumes of data. Prioritize remediation efforts by focusing on:

- **Critical and High CVSS Scores:** Use the results from `cvss_parser.py` to quickly identify vulnerabilities with a CVSS score of 7.0 or higher.
- **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs):** Pay attention to vulnerabilities with known exploits.

## 5. Implement Remediation Workflow

Vulnerability scanning is only effective if issues are resolved. Implement a clear remediation process:

1. **Triage:** Use the risk score calculator (`vulnerability_risk_score_calculator.py`) to rank hosts based on their total risk score.
2. **Assign:** Delegate remediation tasks to the appropriate teams (network, software, DevOps).
3. **Fix:** Apply patches or mitigate vulnerabilities based on priority.
4. **Rescan:** After applying fixes, run another scan to ensure that the vulnerabilities have been resolved.

## 6. Monitor and Review

Track the progress of your vulnerability management program by:

- Maintaining detailed logs and reports of all scans.
- Comparing historical scan results to measure improvement.
- Continuously updating scanning tools and processes to account for new threats and vulnerabilities.

## Summary

By following these best practices, you can create an efficient and effective vulnerability scanning program that keeps your systems secure.
