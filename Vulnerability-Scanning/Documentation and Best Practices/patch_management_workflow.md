# Patch Management Workflow for Vulnerability Remediation

Integrating vulnerability scanning into your patch management process ensures that security vulnerabilities are prioritized and addressed in a timely manner.

---

## 1. Discover Vulnerabilities

- Use automated vulnerability scans (see `/automation`) to regularly discover vulnerabilities across all systems.
- Focus on critical and high-risk systems first.
- Use the CVSS parser (`cvss_parser.py`) to categorize vulnerabilities based on severity.

---

## 2. Prioritize Vulnerabilities

Not all vulnerabilities require immediate attention. Use the following criteria to prioritize:

- **Severity:** CVSS score (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
- **Exploitability:** Determine whether there are known exploits for the vulnerability (e.g., via Exploit DB or CVE Details).
- **Impact:** Assess the potential damage if the vulnerability is exploited (e.g., data breaches, downtime).

---

## 3. Plan Patches and Mitigations

Coordinate with your IT and DevOps teams to plan patching windows and mitigations:

- **Patch Critical Vulnerabilities First:** Address vulnerabilities with known exploits or those with a high CVSS score.
- **Mitigate Where Patching Isn't Possible:** In some cases, immediate patching may not be feasible. Apply temporary mitigations (e.g., disabling vulnerable services, restricting access).

---

## 4. Apply Patches

- Deploy patches in a controlled environment.
- Follow patch management policies to ensure that updates are applied consistently and without disrupting operations.
- Test patches in a staging environment before rolling them out to production systems.

---

## 5. Verify and Rescan

After applying patches, verify that the vulnerabilities have been resolved:

- **Rescan Systems:** Run another vulnerability scan to confirm that the patch was successful.
- **Monitor for Failures:** Ensure that no systems failed to receive or apply the patch correctly.

---

## 6. Document and Report

Maintain detailed documentation of all patching activities:

- **Track Changes:** Keep records of what was patched, when, and by whom.
- **Generate Reports:** Use templates provided in `/report_templates` to create standardized reports for management and compliance.

---

## 7. Continuous Improvement

Patch management should be an ongoing process. Regularly review your workflow and adjust as needed:

- **Evaluate Effectiveness:** Assess how well your patching process is working. Are critical vulnerabilities being patched quickly?
- **Update Tools:** Ensure your scanning tools, patch management software, and processes are up to date.
- **Review Policies:** Regularly review and update patch management policies to reflect new risks and technologies.

---

## Conclusion

By integrating vulnerability scans into your patch management workflow, you can ensure that vulnerabilities are addressed promptly, reducing your organizationâ€™s risk exposure.
