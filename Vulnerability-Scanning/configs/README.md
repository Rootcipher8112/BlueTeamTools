# Configuration Files for Vulnerability Scanning Automation

This folder contains reusable configuration files for automating vulnerability scans using tools like **Nmap**, **Nessus**, and **OpenVAS**. These configuration files help define scan targets, exclusions, and custom profiles to streamline vulnerability scanning workflows.

---

## Configuration Files:

### 1. **Nmap Exclusion File** (`nmap_exclusion.conf`)
   - **Description:** This file lists IP addresses or subnets that should be excluded from Nmap scans. Useful for avoiding known trusted networks or critical systems.
   - **How to Use:**
     - When running an Nmap scan, use the `--exclude` flag and point to this exclusion file:
       ```bash
       nmap -sV --script vuln 192.168.1.0/24 --exclude $(cat nmap_exclusion.conf)
       ```
   - **Customization:** Add or remove IP addresses and subnets based on your specific network environment.

---

### 2. **Nessus Scan Profile** (`nessus_scan_profile.json`)
   - **Description:** A JSON configuration file for Nessus that specifies scan parameters, including the target IP ranges, exclusions, and scan policies.
   - **How to Use:**
     - Upload this profile to Nessus or use the Nessus REST API to automate scans with this profile:
       ```bash
       curl -X POST -H "X-ApiKeys: accessKey=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY" -d @nessus_scan_profile.json https://nessus.local:8834/scans
       ```
   - **Customization:** Modify the `text_targets` and `exclude_ip` sections to reflect your target network and excluded systems.

---

### 3. **OpenVAS Scan Profile** (`openvas_scan_profile.xml`)
   - **Description:** An XML configuration file for automating OpenVAS scans with specified IP ranges, exclusions, and scan parameters.
   - **How to Use:**
     - You can load this XML profile into OpenVAS to automate scans with custom settings.
     - Example command to load the scan profile:
       ```bash
       omp -u admin -w admin_pass --xml "<create_task><config id='scan_profile_id'></config></create_task>"
       ```
   - **Customization:** Update the `<hosts>` and `<exclude_hosts>` tags to reflect the correct target ranges and exclusions.

---

## Customization Guidelines

Each configuration file can be tailored to your specific environment. Be sure to:

1. **Adjust IP ranges and subnets** to match your network infrastructure.
2. **Exclude critical systems or trusted networks** to avoid scanning unnecessary or sensitive areas.
3. **Modify scan policies** to meet your organizationâ€™s security requirements (e.g., full scans, fast scans, compliance checks).
